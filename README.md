## Hi there 👋

![Your GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=YOUR_USERNAME&show_icons=true&theme=radical)


**hackastak/hackastak** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on as many side quests as I can possibly handle.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build 3D games with UE5 and C++.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at all, but if you have something you'd like a second pair of eyes on, I'd
  probably do it simply for the love the game
- 💬 Ask me about Gen AI and building Gen UI using Agent Workflows
- 📫 How to reach me: ahwigint@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I graduated from University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, worked as a biomedical engineer for 6
  years, then switched careers to software engineering where I have been for the past 4 years.
